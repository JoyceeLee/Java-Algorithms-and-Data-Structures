# Java-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This is my note to record Algorithms and Data Structures related questions/realizations with my code. 

I choose to use github as a note book because it is code friendly and I like its layout.

There are some other questions on my blog http://www.cnblogs.com/joycelee/

--PEACE--LOVE--CODE--

p.s. I will copy my blogs to this github repository :D
